# Project Title
SDAIA_LLM_BOOTCAMP_projects


## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data using transformers. The main features include training a transformer-based model on a labeled dataset, evaluating the model's performance, and saving the best model for future use. The project utilizes the Hugging Face library for transformer models and provides a pipeline for sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- Transformers library

### Installation
1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your dataset in a suitable format.
2. Update the necessary variables in the code according to your dataset and requirements.
3. Run the training script to train the sentiment analysis model.
4. Evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics.
5. Save the best model for future use.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in CSV format with two columns: "text" (containing text data) and "label" (containing corresponding sentiment labels). You can provide your own dataset or use publicly available datasets.

## Models
The project utilizes transformer-based models for sentiment analysis. You can choose from various pre-trained models available in Hugging Face's model hub or train your own custom model.

## Training
To train a sentiment analysis model, run the train.py script with appropriate arguments and configurations. This script will load the dataset, initialize the transformer-based model, and perform training using specified hyperparameters.

## Evaluation
After training, you can evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluate.py script provides functions to calculate these metrics on a test dataset.

## Results
The results of sentiment analysis can be presented in various ways such as confusion matrices or performance metrics like accuracy or F1 score. Visualizations can also be created to showcase these results.
